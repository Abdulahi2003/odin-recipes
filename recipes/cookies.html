    <h2>Description</h2>

        comforting aroma and delightful flavor. They are made from
        a dough infused with chocolate chips, yeilding a perfect balance
        of sweet and salty notes. Bakes to golden perfection, each cookie 
        boasts a crisp edge and a chewy center, creating a satisfying 
        texture that melts in the mouth. Whether enjoyed warm from the oven
        with a glass of milk or packed as a portable snack, chocolate chip 
        cookies evoke nostalgia and joy with every delicious bit.
