    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>flour</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Leaveners(baking powder and soda)</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, sugar, baking soda, and baking power, and salt 
            in a large bowl. Beat together milk, eggs, and melted butter
            in a separate bowl. Keep the two mixtures separate until you 
            are ready to cook.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium-high heat.
            You can flick water across the surface and if it beads up and sizzles,
            it's ready.
        </li>
        <li>Put the wet mixture into the dry mixture; use a wooden spoon ot fork to 
            mix until it's just blended together. The batter will be a little lumpy 
            which is what you want.
        </li>
        <li>Pour or scoop the batter onto the preheated griddle, using approximately 
            1/2 cup for each pancale. Cook until bubbles appear on the surface, 1 to 2
            minutes; flip with a spatula and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat
            with remaining batter.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
